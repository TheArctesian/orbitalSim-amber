<h1>Orbital Motion</h1>
The motion of the planets and stars has been an object of fascination for humans since the dawn of time. With the advent of Newton and Kepler we can what our ancient ancestors could not and actually understand their motion. This page is dedicated to describing the physics behind the simulation you see on the <a href="/Simulation">simulation page</a>. 

<h2>Kepler's Laws</h2>

<h2>Orbital Energy</h2>
Energy, when analysing large bodies can be split into two formulas for Kinetic Energy (KE) and Potential Energy (PE).
